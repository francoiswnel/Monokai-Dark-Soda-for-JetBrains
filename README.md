# Monokai Dark Soda for JetBrains IDEs

This is my version of the Monokai Dark Soda colour theme for the JetBrains IDEs, including IntelliJ, Clion, PyCharm, Rubymine, etc.

I modified the colour selection from [buymeasoda's Monokai Dark Soda Theme for Sublime Text](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme), and used Eclectide's Monokai Theme for IntelliJ as a base.

Update: I have republished this theme as its own repository. It was previously forked from buymeasoda's repo as a means to give him attribution, but that didn't make sense as none of the files between the repos were similar.

# How To Install

Download the .jar file. Open your IDE, select Import Settings under the File menu, and navigate to the .jar file.
